# Mobile-App-Design
-Here shows the various projects that I completed in my Mobile Application Design Class<br>
-We used Android Studio to better understanding of what goes into designing an app.<br>
-We worked with Object Oriented Programming in Java, SQL, and Database Design<br>
-For the Projects that have a part a and b, the file was too big so I had to split it in two<br>
